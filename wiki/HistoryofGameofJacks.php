						<p>In Personal Perspective, would love to share the story of this game ,which my grandmother used to play, and is remarkably similar to the game of Jacks. Game called Goti used to be played in played in India. Very prevalent during time of 1945-1980 in rural parts of Bihar, India. Now to put things in perspective : This is the map pf India and the state marked in red is my home state Bihar.</p>
						<p>And by the way Bihar is the place where Buddha found enlightenment.</p>
						<p>So coming back to the story. So 1945-1980 was a very harsh period. India had just jot its Independence from the the British rule in 1947. Economic state of the country was in ruins and especially state of bihar was most poorest of them all. People did not had access to basic amenities like water , electricity , houses etc. Kids during those times did not even had a toys to play with simply because their parents cant afford it. Especially for girls who were not allowed to go outside into the field and play like the boys. It was really really a harsh time but as my grand mother say " You cant tell times are bad if you have never seen a good one". So as a  result kids improvised and started playing this game called Goti , which required nothing but few pebbles. </p>

						<p>The game was fairly simple. There are many versions of it depending on the places and level you are playing. I have explained the basic level below played among 4 people. This game is played with Four people and 5 pebbles. Each player takes their turn one by one.</p>

				<h2>How to Play</h2>
				<p>Take one pebble in your hand , throw it in the air , we call it "guthwa" and mean while it is in the air try to grab any one of the four remaining pebbles on the table and then catch the guthwa. then keep it doing untill you have collected all the pebbles. If your continuity breaks then you note down the points and bring back all the pebbles and give chance to the person sitting next to you.</p>

				<p>The Love Jack is a giant red sculpture situated in the courtyard of Art and Technology building was first in 1976, is iconic of the University’s larger-than-life thinking. Originally called “Jack,” the sculpture was quickly renamed the Love Jack by students who joined its original name with the name of the sculptor, Jim Love. </p>

				<p>My insight was that even though it is considered as one of the icons of the University of Texas at Dallas, not many people are aware of it. Also, there is a giving society named after the sculpture, The Love Jack Society. I decided to create a branding for The Love Jack Society so that more people other than students and visitors will recognize the Love Jack as an icon of UTD.</p>
